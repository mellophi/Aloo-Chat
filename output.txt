 Fertiliser

Nano DAP is a type of fertiliser made up of nano-sized particles of diammonium phosphate (DAP). It is specially designed to provide plants with a more efficient and uniform uptake of the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. Nano DAP is a more concentrated form of the traditional DAP fertiliser, allowing for a more efficient delivery of nutrients to the root system of plants. Additionally, Nano DAP can help to reduce losses due to leaching, run-off and volatilization, making it a more sustainable option for farmers.
